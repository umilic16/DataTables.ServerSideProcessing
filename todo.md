## ðŸ›  In Progress

  - [ ] Add tests (select, multiselect etc.)
  - [ ] Switch to records
  - [ ] Fix filtering dates when the property that is filtered on is datetime

## ðŸ”¥ High priority / Upcoming

  - [ ] Fix global filter for enum types
  - [ ] DateTimeOffset support
  - [ ] Add support for building query (and accessing it) but without executing it
  - [ ] Select/MultiSelect generic (instead of just string) support
  - [ ] CI/CD
  - [ ] Component model for whole header/table

## ðŸ’¡ Low priority / Ideas

  - [ ] Better way of accessing property names (e.g. by some data annotation building with source generator or some method)
  - [ ] Maybe some data annotation on properties which should be included in global filtering
  - [ ] Support for caching
  - [ ] Add examples, improve documentation
  - [ ] Add global configuration support (e.g. modifying Default instance of FilterParsingOptions, RequestParser...)
  - [ ] Custom exceptions
  - [ ] Js helper methods
  - [ ] Add components?
  - [ ] Improve how data is sent from the frontend
  - [ ] Add logging warnings
